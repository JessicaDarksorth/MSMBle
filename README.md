The application scans for any BLE device and its services and characteristics.

If the Yeelight Service is found, an activity can be launched to control colour and intensity of Yeelight Blue bulb

If  SensorTag services are found, an activity can be launched to visualise the state of the buttons, ambient temperature (IR Temperature sensor) 
and humidity from the SensorTag.

If Tethercell service is found, an activity can be launched to change the state (OFF/ON) of the Tethercell battery and visualise its characterisctics

This application has been tested on a Google Nexus 7 (2013 edition)
